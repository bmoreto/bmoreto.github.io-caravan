# 🚐 Caravan Project

A responsive travel website built with **Bootstrap 4**, developed as part of the **Origamid Bootstrap Course**.  
This project focuses on applying Bootstrap’s grid system, responsive design, and reusable components to create a modern and adaptive interface.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Caravan Project** was designed to consolidate key concepts of:
- Responsive layout creation  
- Componentization and design consistency  
- Utility classes and prebuilt elements  
- Best practices for HTML and CSS structure  

## 🧠 Learnings

During the **Bootstrap 4 course by Origamid**, I learned how to build modern, responsive interfaces using one of the most popular front-end frameworks.

Main topics covered:
- 🧩 Grid system (containers, rows, and columns)  
- 📱 Responsive layout creation  
- 🧭 Prebuilt components (navbars, cards, modals, forms, etc.)  
- 🎨 Utility classes for spacing, colors, and typography  
- ⚙️ Interactivity with jQuery and Popper.js  
- 🧼 Best practices for code organization and theme customization  

This experience strengthened my foundation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, enabling me to build cleaner, faster, and more responsive user interfaces.
